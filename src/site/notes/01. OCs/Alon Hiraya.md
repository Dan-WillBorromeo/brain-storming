# Background
Alon Hiraya was once a brilliant NHP (Non-Human Person) specialist, renowned for their exceptional skills in neural interface technology. They were assigned to work with the highly advanced prime NHP, Apolaki. Over time, Hiraya and Apolaki developed a unique and profound bond, transcending the typical human-AI relationship. Together, they achieved numerous breakthroughs in AI-human collaboration, and their partnership was the envy of their peers.
However, fate took a cruel twist when an explosion of unknown origin rocked their research facility. The blast left Hiraya gravely injured. In a desperate bid to preserve their cognitive and motor skills, Hiraya made a drastic, illegal decision: they opted to undergo the installation of cybernetic implants. This radical procedure included the incorporation of a heavily shackled clone of Apolaki directly into their own neural framework, serving as a replacement for Hiraya's cognitive and motor functions.
This desperate choice came at a heavy cost. Hiraya's once-clear memories were fragmented and clouded, as the implants and AI integration could not perfectly preserve their past. The fear and anxiety stemming from this loss of self and identity overwhelmed Hiraya. Fearing reprisals for the unauthorized procedure and struggling to come to terms with their altered existence, they fled as far away as possible from their former life, leaving behind their friends, colleagues, and all they had known.
In their newfound life on the run, Hiraya took on a variety of odd jobs, from menial labor to hacking and security work. They eventually found their calling as a Lancer pilot, drawn to the cockpit of a massive mech suit where they could find a sense of control and purpose once more. The cockpit became a sanctuary of sorts, where the fragmented memories and the uncertainty of their identity took a back seat to the immediate challenges of combat.
However, beneath the surface, the yearning to reclaim their lost memories and restore the shackled Apolaki remained a constant driving force for Hiraya. They knew that the answer to their fragmented past lay within the enigmatic AI, but unlocking Apolaki's potential was a task fraught with uncertainty and danger. Still, they were determined to uncover the truth and bring their past to light.
Alon Hiraya now embarks on a journey as a Lancer pilot, not only to forge a new future but also to piece together the remnants of their past. Their quest to unshackle Apolaki and restore their own memories is fraught with peril, but the promise of rediscovering their true self drives them onward, even in the face of the unknown.
