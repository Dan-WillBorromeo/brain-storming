## Backstory
Hiraya is a second generation immigrant, born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada by her mother Jane Amorsolo and her father Bede Simmons. She developed a fascination in myths and belief systems and got a BA in Folklore at the Memorial University in Newfoundland with a minor in Religious Studies.
Shortly after, she entered into a master’s degree program and signed up for an archeological expedition in her mother’s home country, the Philippines. There, she would find and obsess over a relic. She wound up stealing it, running off to a random city, and spent the following year trying to divine its secrets.
Her act fed Ayahara, a fading deity of hunters and gatherers, enough devotion that it granted Hiraya a share of its powers. She became its primary and sole priestess in the modern age. However, her pact with the deity forbade her entirely from eating meat she did not hunt and butcher nor can she eat fruits she did not gather. While she found out that stealing fruits counts as gathering them, she has yet to find a workaround for meat. She has been craving a burger for two years.

# Practice
Hiraya’s practice takes on two forms. First, she can take on traits of animals from the meat she consumes. Second, she can summon simulacra of animals using its bones. She has yet to find a magical use for the fruit she gathers. In order to use either form of her powers, Hiraya must have personally killed the animal whose meat or bones she uses as a medium.
She dedicates both the act of hunting and butchering food, as well as a portion of her meals, to Ayahara. Afterwards, she turns any leftover meat into jerky to preserve it. She grinds the bones into a fine dust. Both are then stored in separate leather pouches, made from the animal’s skin, and properly labeled. Currently, she has a pouch of frog jerky, a pouch of frog bone dust, a pouch of rat jerky, a pouch of rat bone dust, two pouches of goat jerky, and two pouches of goat bone dust.
When eating an animal’s meat and uttering a short prayer, Hiraya takes on a random trait from it. She cannot choose what trait she gets and cannot voluntarily end the effect.
When tossing the bone dust and uttering a short prayer, Hiraya can summon a skeletal simulacra of that animal. She can give it minor commands and observe the world through it. She can control a maximum of five animals at a time. This number fluctuates based on how complex the animal she summoned is. If not continuously fed power, the simulacra fades in a matter of seconds.
