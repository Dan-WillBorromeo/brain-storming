Hiraya Simmons is a mid-20s archaeology student with a minor in folklore, pursuing her master's degree. Born and raised in Canada, she struggles with connecting to her Pinay heritage due to:

1. Her inability to fluently speak Tagalog, made worse by her cousins mocking her accent during her first and only visit to the Philippines
2. Despite her knowledge of British folklore, she only has surface-level, pop culture understanding of Philippine folklore
3. She looks more British-Canadian than Pinay.

When Jack Morin – a friend and professor at her college – invites her to join a dig for a newly discovered settlement in northern Luzon, she agrees. Hiraya plans to use the opportunity to make a name for herself as an archaeologist and to better connect with her Pinay roots.

She struggles to bond with the team, as the others have established dynamics from working together previously. They treat her professionally but she forms no deep connections. This isolation worsens due to her ex-boyfriend Noah Cruz also being part of the dig. While they remained friends after their breakup, they maintain careful distance from each other. She spends most of her time imagining herself making grand discoveries and talking to Mindy – a yellow budgie her parents got for her and her current best friend.

After a month of documentation and grunt work shared by other interns, Hiraya is finally allowed to help with excavation. She discovers an intricate bone-handled knife carved with symbols and split into three clean pieces.

While no one's looking, Hiraya - enamored with the blade's design and imagining herself giving a demonstration on its use to a large crowd - cuts her palm. The wound is painless and she barely notices it, save for the pooling blood that immediately heals; she assumes this is part of her imagination. This seals a pact with a forgotten deity of hunting and foraging – one that has been starved for worship since its people were wiped out nearly a thousand years ago. Noah notices her sudden reaction, but she hides the wound from him and the others.

Over the following weeks, several changes occur:

- She gradually loses the ability to eat processed foods, then any food she didn't personally hunt or forage
	- Food offered by Morin and Noah remains safe to eat due to her subconscious categorization of them as part of her in-group
- An ancient hunting chant gets stuck in her head, growing louder as the deity gains strength
- Mindy begins repeating only one phrase: "Hiraya, eat"

During a team dinner at a *samgyupsal* restaurant hosted by Morin, Hiraya realizes the food is unappetizing, but the people around her register as potential meals. She tries to act normal but violently vomits after returning home.

When Morin approaches her with concern, trying to get her to open up about her obvious distress, Hiraya is too distracted by hunger and the deity's song to engage properly. She spends the conversation fighting predatory thoughts about how good a meal he would make – thoughts that, for the first time, don't just frighten her but make her feel powerful and focused.

That night, the deity teaches her to hunt through dreams, showing her taking down the archaeology team one by one in a beastly but humanoid form. Rather than being purely horrified, part of her feels exhilarated by the strength and purpose in the vision.

Recognizing the danger she poses, She researches folklore, but incorrectly assumes she's turning into an aswang. Reading that there's no way to prevent the transformation, Hiraya isolates herself from the dig site, staying in a dingy motel with only Mindy for company. 

Overcome by hunger and the deity's growing influence, Hiraya apologizes to Mindy before killing and eating her. The deity, gaining strength from the act, praises her through its song and begins speaking through the dead bird's voice. Despite her guilt, Hiraya feels a disturbing sense of accomplishment and belonging.

Noah arrives with a fruit basket, worried about Hiraya's dramatic weight loss and withdrawal from the team. As her ex-boyfriend, he feels responsible for checking on her – their breakup may have contributed to her isolation, and he recognizes signs of someone in crisis.

Hiraya repeatedly tries to make him leave, but Noah persists, driven by genuine concern and guilt. The deity whispers encouragement to "go on another hunt" while speaking through Mindy's voice in her head. When Noah notices the bird's absence and presses her about it, Hiraya becomes increasingly defensive and angry.

His continued questioning triggers her rage, and she chooses to stop fighting the deity's influence. She transforms for the first time and kills Noah, embracing the power and belonging the deity offers.  The deity, speaking using a combination of Mindy and Noah's voices, praises Hiraya on a successful hunt.

Other notes:
- Hiraya's parents are busy, and rarely have time for her beyond giving her money and what she asks for. Due to this, she's really close to Mindy and views the budgie as her best friend.
- The other archeologists, while treating her professionally, do whisper behind her back and make jokes about her being a privileged white girl.
- When leaving the dig site, Hiraya would avoid modes of transportation that are likely to have her be surrounded by a lot of people.
- Hiraya is prone to making assumptions based off of complete information when under stress; this leads to her making a lot of mistakes, not all of them fixable.
- The crew would assume that the settlement is one of hunters, as the area they are in is poorly adapted to farming but has great biodiversity.
- Other archeologists have been finding tablets talking about the settlement, and that they've recently found what they think might be the place mentioned in those tablets.
- Morin was invited to join a large team who is excavating the site; he took Hiraya along because he knows how much she wants to reconnect with her culture.
- The settlement was wiped out around the year 1200 by neighboring groups who feared them. This led to a lack of worship and devotion for the deity, effectively starving it for a millennia.
- The deity is worshiped primarily by hunting, foraging, and eating in its name. It grants chosen followers more powerful forms that fit their desires.
