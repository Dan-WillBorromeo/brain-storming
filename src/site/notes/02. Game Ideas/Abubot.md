### Setup
1. Arrange the Kwarto cards face up in a line - keep them spaced apart.
2. Shuffle the Kalat cards and place 1 face up on top of each Kwarto card. Make sure the Kwarto cards are still visible.
3. Shuffle the remaining Kalat cards with the Abubot cards and place 1 face up on top of each Kalat card, Make sure the Kalat cards are still visible.

### Turn Structure
1. You can take up to 2 different actions per turn:
	- You can **draw** one card from the deck. 
	- You can **place** any number of cards with matching symbols from hand on top of any room pile. 
	- You can **gather** any number of non-Kwarto cards from a room pile - if they have matching symbols, are touching, and are at the top of the pile.
	- You can **move** any number of non-Kwarto cards from a room pile to the left or right - if they have matching symbols, are touching, and are at the top of the pile.
2. Place a card from hand on top of a room pile, starting from left to right, until you have 3 cards in hand.
3. If all the Abubot cards in a pile match the Kwarto card’s symbol, and there’s no Kalat card in that pile, collect the Abubot cards and flip the Kwarto card face down.
	- Keep the collected Abubot cards in a separate pile in front of you. 
4. If there are 2 or more face down Kwarto cards, the game ends. Tally your points. 
	- All players get 1 point for each face down Kwarto card.
	- All players lose 1 point for each face up Kwarto card.
	- Gain 1 point for each Abubot card you collected with a matching symbol as a face down Kwarto card.
	- Lose 1 point for each Kalat card still in a pile with a matching symbol as your collected Abubot card.    
	- **The player with the most points wins and gets treated to sorbetes by your parents.**
5. Pass the turn to the next player.
