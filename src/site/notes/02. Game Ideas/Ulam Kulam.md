# Ulam Kulam
Ulam Kulam: A card game of culinary chaos and witchcraft
## Core Concept
Ulam Kulam is a card game for 2 to 4 players, where you play as witches in a cooking competition. You must try to finish your recipes on time, while sabotaging the other contestants with your spells. The game is fast-paced, fun, and full of flavor. 
## Target Experience
- A card game that combines cooking and magic, with a Filipino twist.
- Easy to learn, quick to play, and suitable for all ages and skill levels.
- A mix of strategy and luck, with plenty of opportunities for bluffing, cooperation, and betrayal
- A colorful and charming art style, inspired by Filipino culture and cuisine.
## Game Information

## Components
- 20 2.5 x 3.5 cards
## Rules
### Setup
- Shuffle the cards to form your Pantry. Then, deal two (2) cards to each player.
- Each player chooses one (1) card as their Recipe and sets it face down in front of them.
- The person who cooked most recently takes the first turn.
### Turn Structure
Every player is dealt one (1) card at the start of the round. If its the first round, the person who cooked most recently takes the first turn. Else, the person with the least Preserved cards and cards in hand takes the first turn. Play proceeds clockwise.
On your turn, choose one (1) from below:
- **Preserve** - place a card face up next to your Recipe. It becomes Preserved.
- **Cast** - use a spell from a card in hand or a Preserved card.
- **Cook** - Flip your Recipe face up. If you have all required ingredients as Preserved cards, you win the game.
On any other turn, you may Cast a spell from your Preserved cards.
### Spell Resolution
Spells resolved in a “first in, last out” basis. This means that the spell Casted last resolves first, going down the line until the first spell resolves. Once all spells have resolved, they are shuffled back into the Pantry.
### Victory Conditions
- First player to Cook wins!
